TODO CURRENTLY:
 - Read through paper and data thoroughly
 - Read similar papers
 - Compile any relevant methods and data

Main components:
Fish input brain (What input variables should we feed into the neural network)
Fish decision brain (Takes in input variables, decides fish position at next step in time)

Plan:
 - Read paper, see what they do to determine fish movement characteristics
 - Use heuristic + ML approach to determine which fish is looking at who (Further the research of the paper using ML)
 - Decide on input variables / input variable machine for the main fish brain
 - Build fish brain 
 - Test artificial fish accuracy to real fish
 - Test accuracy with 6th fish
 - Attempt to steer the herd using a 6th fake fish
